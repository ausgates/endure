a clichÃ© survival text-based adventure game

~~i might move `endure.rb` into the root project or i might not~~

usage

you'll need [git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trommel/endure
cd endure/
git checkout unstable
gem install rake # if you don't already have it
rake
cd app/bin/lib/
